When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keepiong all your work local?

When you want to get your files into the cloud, for access anywhere by anyone, including yourself

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote respoitory?

Other people might be introducing changes to the project, and you don't nessecarily want all those changes automatically.
